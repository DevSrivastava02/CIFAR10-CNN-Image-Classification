# CIFAR10-CNN-Image-Classification
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories. The trained model is saved and deployed using a Streamlit web application, allowing users to upload images and obtain real-time predictions.
